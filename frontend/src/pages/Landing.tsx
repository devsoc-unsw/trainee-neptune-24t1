              Hi, I'm Timothy, a 4th year med student and your president for this year! You may recognise me from [too long ago] as I've been in this society since the first day of uni :ckHmm:. My intro to puzzles was the MIT mystery hunt, which I hope to help write this year. I recommend you all look at it (if only to see the scale of the puzzling world üëÄ)
              <br/> 
              A lot of my time these days is either spent gaming, at bouldering, or playing maimai. I listen to mostly Japanese music, so any jpop recs are welcome :{'>'} :blobMelt:

            <br/>
            I'm not very good at puzzles but if you start a puzzle race, it is nearly guaranteed that I will join the puzzle then proceed to leave it incomplete after realising I don't know where to begin. ü§° My favourite puzzles are the few logic ones I can solve (ie. skyscrapers and LITS). :W_puzzle:
            <br/>
            Apart from unsuccessfully attempting puzzles, I also like going to the beach, hanging out with friends, listening to the same songs on repeat, and playing the piano. I also love to spam emojis when I message so be prepared. :huh:

            Hey everyone! I‚Äôm Jordan and I‚Äôm in my third year studying economics and commerce, and I‚Äôm also one of the Puzzle Events Directors for this year!
            When I‚Äôm not working I‚Äôm usually reading (fantasy and sci fi are the best), gaming or struggling to play guitar.
            <br/>
            Over the past year I‚Äôve gotten to like all kinds of puzzles but my favourites when I started were rebuses both because they were the only ones I could even remotely solve and because they are very satisfying when they click.

            Hey guys! I'm Jian and I'm one of your fellow Puzzle Events Directors üß© for this year! I am currently in second year and studying an actuarial studies/computer science degree. Some of my hobbies include sleeping, eating yummy food, light gaming and the last one can be figured out through my puzzle below!
            <br/>
            Now, some of my favourite puzzles include cryptics, rebus and basically any puzzle with a creative mechanism! These are especially satisfying when you solve them üßê. Other things I also enjoy doing are hanging out with friends, card games and the occasional ice skating (even when it's cold).
            <br/>
            I'm definitely excited for what this year will bring and I'm looking forward to seeing you all! Also, if you see me on campus, feel free to say hi!

            <br/>
            I love puzzles, as evident in doing those nyt mini dailies everyday (except when i forget, which is often), so I really like word puzzles. However, my absolute favourite ones are when a really unique or creative mechanic is used - solving those feel super satisfying {'>_<'}.
            <br/>
            Outside of puzzles, i really like hanging with friends, listening to music (drop recs!), playing piano/trumpet/guitar, going to the arcade, playing board games and taking walks.

            <br/>
            My fav puzzles are rebuses and logic puzzles! (anything without huge blocks of text (Ôº¥‚ñΩÔº¥) ironic i know).  In my free time I like to draw/make scrapbooks, watch cartoons (feel free to discuss shows with me), hang out with friends, rollerblade, and play musical instruments (i own a lot). I listen to a variety of music genres but my fav is pop punk.
